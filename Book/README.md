This folder contains a chapter of the book Analytic Trends in Mathematical Physics 
published by the American Mathematical Society as part of the series Contemporary Mathematics. 
The chapter is titled Perspectives on Exponential Random Graphs. The goal of the chapter 
is to give a short introduction to the state of research into exponential random graph models 
at the time of its writing in 2018. I wrote this chapter with minimal suggestions and support 
from my research advisor, Dr. Mei Yin. Included is a background into the theory of 
exponential random graphs, key theorems and results in their study, and motivation for how these 
results come about and are extensions to simpler mathematical concepts. 

Analytic Trends in Mathematical Physics is the proceedings of the Arizona School of 
Mathematical Physics held at the University of Arizona, Tucson in 2018. Quoting the 
editors of this work,
> A main goal of this school was to introduce graduate students and postdocs to exciting topics of current research that are both influenced by physical intuition and require the use of cutting-edge mathematics.
